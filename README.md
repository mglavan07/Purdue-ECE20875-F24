Homework and projects from ECE20875: Python for data science. 

This repository documents my work and progress in ECE20875 taken in fall 2024. 
Through this course, I was able to master the use of Python for file IO, data structures, object-oriented programming, and 
classification, clustering, and regression algorithms.

Please check out the files from homeowrk as well as my final project!
